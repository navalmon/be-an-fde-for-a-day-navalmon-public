# Task 2: Customer Brief

The customer has document images (receipts, invoices, financial statements, medical forms) that are only useful once they're structured data. Manual extraction is slow, inconsistent, and doesn't scale.

They want an API: send an image and a target schema, get back stable JSON. The fields vary per document type, but the quality bar is the same: accurate extraction with consistent formatting.

## What breaks trust

- Missing fields that are clearly visible in the image
- Hallucinated values the document doesn't support
- Inconsistent formatting (returning `"$1,234"` for one field and `"1234"` for another)
- Clean digital scans work fine but photographed or scanned documents fall apart
